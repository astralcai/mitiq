# Probabilistic Error Amplification

Probabilistic Error Amplification (PEA) is an error mitigation technique in which error amplification sequences of gates are applied probabilistically at different noise levels. 
Estimates of expectation values are obtained by averaging over different noisy circuits at each noise level.
The ideal expectation value is inferred by extrapolating the estimated expectation values to the zero-noise
limit {cite}`Kim_2023_Nature`.

Detailed documentation on the PEA technique will be made available in future Mitiq releases.
